     \item[1] In this table, I am reporting the estimates of equation \ref{eqFR1}. I present the results of the effect of ethnic favoritism on primary school completions in column 1, infant survival in column 2, wealth quintile in column 3, electrification in column 4 and access to clean drinking water in column 4. Primary school completion is a dummy variable that is equal to one if a person completed primary school and zero otherwise. Infant survival is a dummy variable that is equal to one if an infant survived the first 12 months of life. Electrification is a dummy variable that is equal to one if a household has electricity. Finally, access to clean drinking water is an ordinal variable that has values from 1, worst water source, to 4.
     \item[2] Standard errors are clustered on ethnic groups. All results include ethnic group, time and age fixed effects.
