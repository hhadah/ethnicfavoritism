\item[1] \footnotesize{In this table, I am reporting the estimates of equation \ref{eq1}. 
                      I present the results of the interaction between the coethnic variable and 
                      \textit{Polity IV } groups on primary school completions in column 1, infant 
                      survival in column 2, wealth quintile in column 3, electrification in column 4 
                      and access to clean drinking water in column 4. Primary school completion is a 
                      dummy variable that is equal to one if a person completed primary school and 
                      zero otherwise. Infant survival is a dummy variable that is equal to one if an 
                      infant survived the first 12 months of life. Electrification is a dummy variable
                      that is equal to one if a household has electricity. Finally, access to clean 
                      drinking water is an ordinal variable that has values from 1, worst water source, to 4.}
\item[2] \footnotesize{\textit{Polity IV } score in this specification is continuous. It takes
                      values that range from most autocratic $-10$ to most democratic $10$}
\item[3] \footnotesize{Standard errors are clustered on ethnic groups. All 
                      results include ethnic group, time and age fixed effects.}
