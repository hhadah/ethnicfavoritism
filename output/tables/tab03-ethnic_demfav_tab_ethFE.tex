\item[1] \footnotesize{In this table, I am reporting the estimates of equation \ref{eq2}. 
                      I present the results of the interaction between the coethnic variable 
                      and \textit{Polity IV } groups on primary school completions in column 1, 
                      infant survival in column 2, wealth quintile in column 3, electrification in 
                      column 4 and access to clean drinking water in column 4. Primary school completion 
                      is a dummy variable that is equal to one if a person completed primary school and 
                      zero otherwise. Infant survival is a dummy variable that is equal to one if an infant 
                      survived the first 12 months of life. Electrification is a dummy variable that is equal 
                      to one if a household has electricity. Finally, access to clean drinking water is an 
                      ordinal variable that has values from 1, worst water source, to 4.}
\item[2] Democracies have a \textit{Polity IV } $\in [10, 5]$, anocracies have a \textit{Polity IV } 
                      $\in [4, -5]$ and autocracies, the omitted group, have a \textit{Polity IV } $<-5$.
\item[3] \footnotesize{Standard errors are clustered on country specific ethnic groups. All 
                      results include ethnic group, time and age fixed effects.}
