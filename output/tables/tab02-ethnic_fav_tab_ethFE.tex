\item[1] \footnotesize{In this table, I am reporting the estimates of equation \ref{eqFR1}. 
                      I present the results of the effect of ethnic favoritism on primary school completions 
                      in column 1, infant survival in column 2, wealth quintile in column 3, electrification in 
                      column 4 and access to clean drinking water in column 4. Primary school completion is a 
                      dummy variable that is equal to one if a person completed primary school and zero otherwise. 
                      Infant survival is a dummy variable that is equal to one if an infant survived the first 12 
                      months of life. Electrification is a dummy variable that is equal to one if a household 
                      has electricity. Finally, access to clean drinking water is an ordinal variable that has 
                      values from 1, worst water source, to 4.}
\item[2] \footnotesize{Standard errors are clustered on country specific ethnic groups. All results include ethnic group, time and age fixed effects.}
